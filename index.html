      <p>Hi, I’m Aishah. And as you’ve probably guessed, I quite like pool. I have been living in London for almost 8 years now.
        I graduated in 2018 and have worked mainly in customer service roles since then.<br><br>My first experience coding was in 2013,
        during a gap year placement. I wanted to streamline repetitive tasks and so I learnt VBA and used it to automate files input/output.
        I started by simply looking at the code that was generated from recording a macro and progressed to more complicated commands,
        using it where I could to increase efficiency and minimise human error. Before long, I was creating massive excel files that acted as a database,
        template and input form for our team.<br><br>Programming with VBA was definitely the highlight of my work there. I loved solving the puzzles and problems
        that came up while coding and found it satisfying being able to check and see immediately whether or not the code works. Carefully considering every
        possible way something could go wrong and persevering through bugs until a fully functional code is reached is such a rewarding feeling.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="faq" class="tabcontent">
      <p>I first heard of founders and coders while I was still at university. I joined an information session in May 2019 and decided then to consider coding
        as a career as I had only fond memories of my time coding in the past.<br><br>I made it a goal to apply to the summer cohort and started working on the
        prerequisites.<br><br>I enjoy programming and I can see myself doing this as a lifelong career. I believe this is an environment I can thrive in. </p>

    <div id="whyprog" class="tabcontent">
      <ul>
        <li>Founders and Coders is a great opportunity to break into Web Development.</li>
        <li>I like how it is based on the principle of reciprocity and paying it forward. Aspiring developers who might not otherwise have this opportunity can have their costs covered  by the F&C. Being able to contribute back to the community is highly rewarding and I identify strongly with the core values of cooperation, inclusion and social impact.</li>
        <li>Location – having lived in London for almost 8 years, I am very happy here and its an additional plus.</li>
        <li>Tech for better – great opportunity to give back while gaining experience.</li>
        <li>Peer-led learning – I have already learnt a lot through the pair programming at the online workshops. Highly collaborative and it simulates a working environment.</li>
        <li>Supportive network – everyone I have met have been super nice and supportive and I would be very happy to be a part of the network.</li>
      </ul>
