        <div id="about" class="tabcontent">
          <p>Hi, I’m Aishah, and as you might be able to see from the images on this page, I quite like pool.
            I have been living in London for almost 8 years now. I graduated from UCL  in 2018 and have worked in customer service roles since then.<br><br>
            My first experience  coding was in 2013, during a gap year placement. I wanted to streamline repetitive tasks and so, I took the initiative to learn VBA
            and used it to automate production of basic reports. I started by looking at the code generated from recording a macro and progressed to more complicated commands,
            using it to increase efficiency and minimise human error. Before long, I was creating sophisticated spreadsheet tools with custom user templates and input forms to
            collate data in order to produce pertinent analysis and reports. I received a Business Improvement Bonus for my part in improving efficiency in the workplace.<br><br>
            Programming with VBA was definitely the highlight of my work there. I loved solving the puzzles and problems that came up while coding and found it satisfying being able
            to check and see immediately whether the code works. Carefully considering every possible way something could go wrong and persevering through bugs until I'd create a fully
            functioning piece of code is such a rewarding feeling. The memory of this sense of achievement is one of the main reasons I have decided to retrain and pursue a career in tech.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="whyprog" class="tabcontent">
          <p>There are many reasons why  I think  Founders and Coders is an incredible initiative. I have listed the major reasons I think so and decided to apply to the programme below:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Opportunity -  Founders and Coders is a great opportunity to break into Web Development. I feel I have learnt so much just by completing this application process and I look forward to learning so much more if accepted onto the course.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Values - I like how it is based on the principle of reciprocity and paying it forward. Some aspiring developers might not otherwise have this opportunity and can give back by
              becoming future contributors to the community. I identify strongly with the core values of cooperation, inclusion and social impact. These unique values have set the FAC apart from other avenues into coding and are a major reason I have invested so much time and effort into this process. </li>
            <br>
            <li>Tech for better – I think this initiative provides a great opportunity to contribute while gaining experience and provide an opportunity to connect to non-profits.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Peer-led learning – FAC is remarkable in the amount of collaboration you do from early on, which is more realistic for the working environment in tech.
              I have already learnt a lot through pair programming during the online workshops and even organised a few extra sessions with other applicants while working
              on the prerequisites. I have very much enjoyed the collaboration. Completing these workshops have only strengthened my desire to dedicate myself to pursuing this as a career.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Supportive network – Everyone I have met has been extremely nice  and supportive. I would be very happy to become a part of this network.
              It is a network I believe I can contribute to and fit well in . I have thoroughly enjoyed becoming a member of this community and I look forward to
              learning and collaborating with more people in the future.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Location – Having lived in London for almost 8 years, I am very happy to be potentially able to take this course in this fantastic city and intend to seek employment in London after the course.</li>
          </ul>
