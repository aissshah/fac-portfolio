# Founders and Coders Portfolio Site

 This site was created as part of the prerequisites for application to Founders and Coders. I'm hoping to join the Summer 2020 cohort.
 If you haven't heard of them, here is a <a href="foundersandcoders.com">link</a> to their website. 

Happy viewing. Constructive criticism welcome!

<u>What I would change next time</u>
1. For responsiveness, create in mobile first.
2. Improve accessibility of the website.
