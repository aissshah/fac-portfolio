# Founders and Coders Portfolio Site

 This site was created as part of the prerequisites for application to Founders and Coders. I'm hoping to join the Summer 2020 cohort.
 If you haven't heard of them, here is a <a href="https://foundersandcoders.com">link</a> to their website. 

Happy viewing. Criticism welcome!

What I would change next time:
1. Consider responsiveness from the start, rather than as an afterthought.
2. Improve accessibility of the website.
3. When in doubt, draw it out. Also, have a draft on paper before typing any code.
